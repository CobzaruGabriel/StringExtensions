/*StringExtensions Library provides comprehensive string extension methods that go behold just the common string validation methods extending the .Net System.string class. The idea to create such a library was motivated by the lack of such a StringUtil library such as org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils in the the .Net realm. The aim of this library is to serve as a goto library for those wishing to have such a library readily available to incorporate in to new or existing projects.
